Wheatstone-Bridge-Thermistor-Precision-Temperature-Sensing

Designed a thermistor-based temperature sensing system using a Wheatstone bridge and Arduino DAQ. Converted differential bridge voltage to resistance, calibrated via Steinhart–Hart coefficients derived through curve fitting, and implemented real-time temperature estimation with moving-average noise reduction.
