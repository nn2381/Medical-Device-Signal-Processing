Real-time stride detection and gait rate estimation using Hall-effect sensing and embedded biomedical signal processing.

This project implements a Hall-effect sensor–based wearable gait detection system developed for clinical stride-rate monitoring applications. The system acquires magnetic field data generated by periodic limb motion and processes the signal in real time using embedded C++ on an Arduino platform to estimate stride interval and gait rate.

The signal-processing pipeline includes analog acquisition and voltage scaling, magnetic field conversion, derivative-based event detection, thresholding and debounce logic to suppress noise, and FFT-based frequency-domain analysis for validation of step frequency. Both time-domain stride interval estimation and frequency-domain gait rate estimation are computed and compared to assess accuracy and robustness of the sensing approach.

This work was developed as part of biomedical signal processing training for medical device applications, with emphasis on embedded implementation, real-time physiological sensing, and translation toward wearable clinical monitoring systems such as rehabilitation tracking and mobility assessment tools. Performance evaluation considered sampling rate constraints, implementation complexity on microcontrollers, and suitability for closed-loop or continuous monitoring applications.
