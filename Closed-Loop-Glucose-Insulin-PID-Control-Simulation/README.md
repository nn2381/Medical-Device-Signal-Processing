Closed-Loop-Glucose-Insulin-PID-Control-Simulation

Implemented a physiological glucose–insulin regulatory model on Arduino to simulate diabetic and non-diabetic metabolic dynamics. Developed open-loop and closed-loop insulin delivery strategies including bolus dosing, basal infusion, and PID-controlled artificial pancreas behavior. Demonstrates control systems engineering applied to biomedical device design.
